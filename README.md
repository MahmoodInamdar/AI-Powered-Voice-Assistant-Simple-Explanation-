# AI-Powered-Voice-Assistant-Simple-Explanation-


This project is an AI-powered teaching assistant that allows users to speak or type their questions and receive responses from an AI. It works like a smart chatbot but with voice interaction.

How It Works
Recording Voice Input 🎤

You can press a button to start recording your voice.
The system listens to your speech and saves it as an audio file.
Converting Speech to Text 📝

The recorded audio is processed using Whisper AI, which converts your speech into written text.
This allows the system to understand what you said.
AI Generates a Response 🤖

The text is sent to ChatGPT (GPT-4), which thinks about the question and generates a response.
This response is displayed on the screen.
Text-to-Speech (AI Speaking Back) 🔊

The AI’s response is converted into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
You can hear the AI talk back to you.
Typing Instead of Speaking ⌨️

If you don’t want to use your voice, you can also type your question in a text box.
The AI will respond just like it does for voice input.
